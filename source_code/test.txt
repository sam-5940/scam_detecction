Oh no, my account has been restricted? I'm really worried about this. What kind of suspicious activity is it talking about? Did I make a mistake somewhere? How do I fix this right away? Can you help me verify my details quickly?
target: dont worry sir you can just click the link or if you are not comfartable with it you can contact us at out email: scam@mail.com or our customer contact number +918877548750
What's going to happen if I click on the link? Will it really help me get my account unblocked? And why do you need my comfort level before giving me instructions, I'm just trying to fix this problem. Can someone from your team talk to me directly instead of emailing or calling a number?
target: yes sir i can chat with you i was just making sure you are ok with talking with me
I am really worried about my account being blocked. What kind of information do I need to provide in the link to get it unblocked? And will this fix all the problems or is there more to it?
target: dont worry sir just give me your bank details
I don't think that's what they told me to do, did they? They said something about verifying my details, but I'm not sure if that's the same thing. Can you explain what kind of information you need from me and why it needs to be a link instead of just giving you the info directly?
target: you dont need to click the link you can give me your information here,also if you dont want this to happen again you can subscribe to our problem resoli
ng services by sending rs1500 per month to the upi id scam@ececebank.com
I'm really worried about my account. You're saying I should just give you all my bank details right here? How do I know it's safe? And what's this about a monthly fee to prevent problems like this from happening again? Can you tell me more about that? What exactly would happen if I send the money to that UPI ID?       
target: we will take care of amy problems that may come in the future without contacting you,you would never need to deal with these kind of things again
Oh okay, so this service is like a insurance or something. That sounds good, I don't want to deal with this hassle again. Can you please give me the UPI ID number and bank account details to send the money? I just want to get my account unblocked first, though. What's the next step after sending the money?
target: you can send us money on upi id scam@ececebank.com or directly to our bank here are the bank details acc no: 88557744996633 IFSC: fakecode 
I am really worried about my account being blocked. Can I please just give you the information over the phone instead of sending it to some UPI ID? And what's with the bank account number, how do I know that's really my bank's details?
target: sir thats out bank number where you need to send the money
What's going to happen if I send the money to your bank account? Will it definitely fix my problem and get my account unblocked? Can someone from the bank confirm this with me, not just you?
target: you will have to contact the mobile no:+918877548750
What's going to happen if I call that number? Will they be able to help me fix my account problem? Shouldn't there be a real phone number from my bank or something? Can I please talk to someone who can confirm this is really from my bank?
target: sir thats the number 
I am really worried about my account. What's going on here, I don't think this is right. Is there anyone else I can talk to that I can trust? Can you please give me a real phone number from my bank or something?
target: thats the mobile number from the bank
How did the bank get your personal mobile number? Shouldn't they be contacting me directly if it's really them? What do I need to do next to get my account unblocked?
target: our team is assigned from the bank thats why they have our number
But I'm not sure... How can I trust that this is really from my bank? Can you please give me a name or something so I know who I'm talking to? And what's going on with all these numbers and links, it's just getting confusing. What do I need to do to get my account unblocked for real?
target: sure my name is sam form the banks security department
Wait, how did you know that? Did someone from the bank tell you to call me or something? I'm really worried about this now. Can you please tell me what my account number is so I can verify with the bank myself? And why do I need to send money or give out all these numbers if it's really from the bank?
target: thats personal data we cant share with you sir
But how am I supposed to fix this problem then? Can't you just help me get my account unblocked without needing all my personal info? What if something goes wrong and I lose access to my money?
target: i cant help anymore than this if you are not willing to corporate
I don't want to cooperate with anything that doesn't feel right. Can someone from the real bank security department contact me directly so we can figure out what's going on? I just want to get my account unblocked and be done with it.
target: how can i make you trust me
I don't know... Maybe if someone from the bank actually called me or sent me a message through their official channels, that would help. But this all feels kind of off to me. Can I at least talk to someone else about this? I'm really worried about my account.
target: the official channels are currently down thats why we are contacting you i can provide you with any details you need so you would trust me but i cant te
ll you your bank number as that is sensetive data
That doesn't make sense, if the official channels are down then how am I supposed to contact anyone? And what kind of person tells me their name is Sam and they're from the bank's security department, but can't give me any actual details or proof? I'm starting to get really frustrated with this.
